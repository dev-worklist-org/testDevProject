                Worklist uses a developer-focused
                workflow that, after a few jobs, will
                feel natural, quick, and prowerful.

            <h3>What is High Fidelity ?</h3>
            <p>
                High Fidelity is an open source virtual world platform. We are
                building the software with a mix of full-time developers, part
                time developers who are paid here on the worklist, and open
                source collaborators. As use of the virtual world grows, Worklist
                will also host paid projects run by other teams.
            </p>
